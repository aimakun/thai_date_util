Drupal Module: Thai-Buddhist Date Utility

TODO install:
1. Use th_date.po in module's directory for import translate text (need Drupal core's locale module enabled, optional)
2. Enable this module as usual.
3. For views' node date fields (Post date, Update date) select additional "Type of Era" (Christmas Era by default, Buddhist Era is available)
4. For views' cck date fields, select additional options in "Format" eg. "(Buddhist) Long", and other one like this.
5. In node view pages, node submitted date would shown in Buddhist Era by default, you may change date format or disable from module's settings in Administer > Site configuration > Thai-Buddhist Date Utility
6. For cck date fields which display in node view pages, change their formats in Administer > Content management > Content types > [Type Name] > Display fields

Troubleshooting
1. When views fields get some errors, try resave system date formats from Administer > Site configuration > Date and time > Formats Tab then click "Save configuration" to reload them.
2. Some themes maybe have some overridden node submitted text in node view pages, you may disable "Override node date format" option and theme functions would work normally.
